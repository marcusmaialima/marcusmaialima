### Hi there! 😁

My name is Marcus Maia from Brazil. I've been working as Front-End. I have been working with development since the end of 2018 and I have participated in projects creating applications and web platforms.

In my free time I like to play on the computer, watch movies and anime, read books in kindle and practice meditation.

I'm currently studying react, nextJS, remix and I'm love study  javascript :)

Would you like to find me?
